  ABOUT THE FIELD3D LIBRARY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field3D is an open source library for storing voxel data. It provides C++ 
classes that handle in-memory storage and a file format based on HDF5 that 
allows the C++ objects to be written to and read from disk.

The majority of the documentation is available in the project Wiki at 
http://code.google.com/p/field3d/

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  LICENSE
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The Field3D source code is distributed under the "New BSD" license.
See the file called COPYING for details.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  FIELD3D DEPENDENCIES
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field3D was originally developed under CentOS. It has also been tested
under MacOS X Leopard.

The make system used by Field3D is SCons. You will need to install it
before compiling Field3D if you want to use the supplied setup.
More information about SCons is available at: http://www.scons.org/

The libraries required for Field3D are:

  boost (1.34.0)
  IlmBase (1.0.1)
  HDF5 (1.8.x)

Boost can be downloaded from 
  http://www.boost.org/

More information about HDF5 can be found at: 
  http://www.hdfgroup.org/HDF5/

Field3D has only been compiled and tested using the IlmBase 1.0.1, 
though earlier versions of the combined OpenEXR, which included the
Imath library, may also work.
More information about IlmBase/OpenEXR can be found at: 
  http://www.openexr.com/

To use a math library other than Imath - see the section USING A 
CUSTOM MATH LIBRARY below.

Under MacOS X, MacPorts is a useful utility for installing the libraries
needed. The installation files for MacPorts can be found at:
  http://www.macports.org/

After installing MacPorts, just type:

> sudo port install scons
> sudo port install boost
> sudo port install hdf5-18
> sudo port install ilmbase

  BUILDING FIELD3D
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field3D was originally developed under CentOS. It has also been tested
under MacOS X Leopard.

By default, Field3D will look in your platform's standard directories 
for include files and libraries. If your libraries reside elsewhere,
refer to the CUSTOMIZING THE BUILD ENVIRONMENT section below.

If you are compiling on an untested platform, you may need to extend the
"systemIncludePaths" and "systemLibPaths" dictionaries in the file
called BuildSupport.py. 

To build Field3D, go to the root directory and type "scons". This will
build a shared and a static library and place them in the "install"
folder. By default an optimized/release build is created.

To build a debug version, type "scons debug=1".

To build a 64-bit version, type "scons do64=1".

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  CUSTOMIZING THE BUILD ENVIRONMENT
------------------------------------------------------------------------

Field3D will look in your platform's standard directories for include
files and libraries. If you need to add further library paths, include
paths etc., add a "Site.py" file in the root directory. 

The file ExampleSite.py can be used for reference.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
  USING A CUSTOM MATH LIBRARY
------------------------------------------------------------------------

The "Site.py" file can be used to change the math library used by
Field3D. The only current requirement is that the other library is
syntactically equivalent to Imath. At Sony Imageworks, the Imath library
is wrapped in an "SPI" namespace - the ExampleSite.py and SpiMathLib.h 
files shows an example of how to configure it.
